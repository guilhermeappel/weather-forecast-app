# Weather Forecast Application

This application connects to public weather and geocoding REST APIs to provide a 7-day forecast based on a specified postal address. It uses the US Census Geocoding service to convert postal addresses into latitude and longitude and fetches weather data from the US National Weather Service API.

## Prerequisites

- .NET Core SDK
- Node.js and npm
- Visual Studio (preferably the latest version)

## How to Run

### Backend Setup

1. **Open the Backend Project**:
    - Open Visual Studio.
    - Navigate to the location where you cloned/downloaded the repository.
    - Open the `Weather.Forecast` solution file.
   
2. **Run the Backend**:
    - In Visual Studio, make sure `Weather.Forecast.API` is set as the startup project.
    - Click on the 'Run' button or press `F5` to start the backend server.

### Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to the Frontend Directory**:
    ```bash
    cd path/to/repository/frontend
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Start the Frontend**:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

Once started, the frontend will allow you to find the weather forecast for specified postal addresses. It's a straightforward page: simply fill in the text field with an address and hit 'Search'.

**Some example addresses to try:**
- 1002 N 7th Ave, Phoenix, AZ 85007, USA
- 86 Brattle Street Cambridge, MA 02138
- 4600 Silver Hill Rd, Washington, DC 20233
